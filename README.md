The vector space model for documents
====================================

The program vsm.py implements a toy search engine to illustrate the
vector space model for documents.

The program asks you to enter a search query, and then returns all
documents matching the query, in decreasing order of cosine
similarity, according to the vector space model.

The document corpus consists of just four documents, which are product
descriptions of popular books, taken from Amazon.com.
